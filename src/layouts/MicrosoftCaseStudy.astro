    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>In Spring 2022, Microsoft approached Berkeley Innovation with a collaborative project in mind, aimed at improving tools for B2B sellers. 
        <br /><br />
        Recognizing the inefficiencies in the seller's workflow, my team and I conducted interviews and workshops to gain insights. We subsequently designed a mobile platform that streamlines seller tasks, enabling them to connect with potential buyers and automate manual processes. This project ultimately garnered enthusiastic feedback from Microsoft's Digital Transformation Studio and continues to progress toward a future release.</p>

        <h4>Enhanced Seller-Client Matchmaking</h4>
        <p>The existing seller experience involves a complex process of researching and funneling clients before connecting them to a seller. Our solution aims to streamline this process by offering sellers access to potential clients, comprehensive information, and AI-driven recommendations that highlight the suitability of the buyer.</p>

        <h4>Buyer-Seller Engagement Plugin</h4>
        <p>A Microsoft Teams plugin empowering buyers to opt in for seller outreach while providing a platform for sellers to connect. Our objective is to offer buyers the chance to engage while maintaining control over unsolicited contact. This plugin facilitates curated interactions, putting the buyer in the driver's seat of the communication process.</p>

Additionally, sellers can seamlessly integrate their Primary CRM account with our platform, ensuring a cohesive and efficient workflow. This solution aims to elevate productivity by eliminating manual processes.</p>

            <h4>A high percentage of seller's time is not actually devoted to selling.</h4>
            <p>We focused on two types of sellers, the Inside Seller and the Field Seller. Most of our sellers' time was spent across a plethora of tools and communication systems, hindering the sales process.</p>

    <p>With little known about a seller’s workflow, we wanted to get a better idea of the tools they were spending time in. For us this meant breaking the space into the types of tools and trying to jump into a popular CRM, such as Salesforce.</p>

        <p>Given the timeline of our project, there were just too many tools that we would not be able to understand and consider. It was beneficial to know that many tools are built to work in line with the sellers CRM and that most software exist in overlapping spaces to meet many seller needs.</p>

    <p class="graySpacedSectionHeader">THE CHALLENGE</p>

        <h4>Prospecting Flow</h4>
        <img class="fullSizeImage" src={prospectingIteration.src} width={prospectingIteration.width} height={prospectingIteration.height} />
        <p>Originally aiming to match the interactions existant in personal apps, we initially turned towards dating apps. This had many problems and we knew we needed to prioritize them being able to manage their ongoing prospects as well as being able to choose from more than just one buyer.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="flex24px" class="casestudy-container48">
        <h4>Contacts Exploration</h4>
        <img style="max-width: 60%; margin: auto;"class="fullSizeImage" src={messagingIteration.src} width={messagingIteration.width} height={messagingIteration.height} />
        <p>Early in our designs, we wanted to prioritize helping the seller close a sale. Because of this, we tried to show their contacts with a focus on their sale progress. Upon further exploration, we found that to not be helpful. Our final iteration focused on them being able to recognize their clients, view the status of their sale through their last message, and properly organize their buyers.</p>

        <h4>Outreach Exploration</h4>
        <img class="fullSizeImage" src={outreachIteration.src} width={outreachIteration.width} height={outreachIteration.height} />
        <p>A seller on the go is looking to have all of the information they need where they need it. This meant knowing their client in order to make decisions and being able to progress the sale. Ultimately, we separated the buyer’s information into separate pages to reduce confusion while incorporating the Microsoft applications they needed to set up future calls with their buyer.</p>
